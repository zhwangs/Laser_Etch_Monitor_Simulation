"""EMpy: Electromagnetic Python.

The package contains some useful routines to study electromagnetic problems with Python.

    1. An implementation of the L{Transfer Matrix<EMpy.transfer_matrix>} algorithm, both isotropic and anisotropic.
    2. An implementation of the L{Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis<EMpy.RCWA>}, both isotropic and anisotropic.
    3. A collection of L{Modesolvers<EMpy.modesolvers>} to find modes of optical waveguides.
    4. A library of L{materials<EMpy.materials>}.

It is based on U{numpy<http://numpy.scipy.org>} and U{scipy<http://www.scipy.org>}.
